# asp.net-core-6-projects
Projects written in ASP.NET core 6 MVC, Blazor WASM, and Blazor Server that I am following along with as I read "Pro ASP.NET Core 6: Develop Cloud-Ready Web Applications using MVC, Blazor, and Razor Pages" by Adam Freeman. 

I didn't give myself enough credit today for working several hours on this stuff, so I'm committing this for it to show up in my commit history.
